## dependency
- newspaper3k

## gazettes that I will source
There will be both Turkish and English sources. For Turkish sources they are categorized as:

- Socialist/Communist(Far-left)
- Secular/Kemalist(Center-left)
- Conservative/Liberal(Center-right)
- Nationalist/Fundementalist(Far-right)

This categorization is not efficient politics wise and the demo build has only 1 for every category, but it does the job for now.

- Socialist/Communist(Far-left): [Birgün]()
- Secular/Kemalist(Center-left): [Sözcü](https://www.sozcu.com.tr/)
- Conservative/Liberal(Center-right): [Hürriyet]()
